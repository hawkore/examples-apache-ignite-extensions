# Hawkore's extensions for Apache Ignite

Expand the indexing, persistence and schema mutation capabilities of Apache Ignite's distributed SQL database.

- Instantly deploy a reliable cluster after reboot, using Apache Lucene and H2 Spatial indexes with disk persistence and automatic re-indexing.
- Combine Apache Ignite's SQL capabilities with Apache Lucene's extended filters.
- Modify Apache Ignite's SQL schemes with no need to restart and zero loss of data.

"Apache Ignite(TM) is a memory-centric distributed database, caching, and processing platform for
transactional, analytical, and streaming workloads, delivering in-memory speeds at petabyte scale."
